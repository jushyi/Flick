# Phase 37.1: Darkroom Visual Feedback - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The darkroom button on the camera screen should communicate two things at a glance: how many photos are in the darkroom AND whether they're still developing or ready to view. This is functional feedback - a status indicator, not theatrical or over-the-top.

For the reveal gesture, the current press-and-hold interaction is replaced with a swipe. There's an arrow affordance that users can grab and pull left to right to trigger the reveal. Same overall look as current, just a different interaction pattern.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Count + state clarity** - Users instantly see both the number of photos AND whether they're developing or ready
- **Intuitive swipe gesture** - The pull-to-reveal arrow feels natural and satisfying to use
- Both features are equally important - neither is secondary

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Reveal animation changes - the actual photo reveal animation stays exactly as-is
- Triage gesture changes - keep/delete swipe gestures remain unchanged
- No theatrical "charging up" or dramatic anticipation building - this is functional feedback

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Use existing brand colors (purple/pink from design system) for button gradient states
- Arrow visual affordance for the swipe-to-reveal gesture
- Horizontal left-to-right swipe direction for reveal
