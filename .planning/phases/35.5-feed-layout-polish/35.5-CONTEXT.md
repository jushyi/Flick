# Phase 35.5: Feed Layout Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The feed should feel like Instagram's seamless scroll - one continuous surface where content flows without jarring section breaks. Stories sit directly below the black header bar (with logo and notifications), and feed cards follow immediately below. No "Feed" label creating visual separation.

Progress bar and emoji footer should go full-width edge-to-edge, matching the screen edges. Everything aligns perfectly - when you scroll, it's one cohesive experience from header to stories to feed cards.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual consistency** - Progress bar, emoji footer, and photo edges all align to screen edges
- **Seamless scroll** - Transition from stories to feed cards feels like one continuous surface
- **Clean header** - Remove "Feed" label so stories breathe directly below logo/nav bar

All three are equally critical - this is one cohesive polish pass that ships together.

## What's Out of Scope

- Story card redesign - not changing how story cards themselves look, just layout/spacing
- Feed card changes - not touching the feed card design, only container/header around them
- New interactions - no new gestures or tap behaviors, pure visual polish

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Instagram feed feel - that seamless scroll where content flows without section breaks
- Edge-to-edge alignment for progress bar and emoji footer (screen edges, not photo edges)
