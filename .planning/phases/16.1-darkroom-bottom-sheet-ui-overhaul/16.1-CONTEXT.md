# Phase 16.1: UI Overhaul for Darkroom Bottom Sheet - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The darkroom bottom sheet (triggered by tapping the photo card button on camera screen) gets a complete visual overhaul to feel premium and polished with a dark theme consistent with the rest of the app.

**Header Area (Top Left):**
- "Darkroom" title
- Status indicator dot to the right of title: green if photos revealed, red if still developing
- Status text underneath: "Photos still developing" or "(X) ready to reveal"

**Photo Cards (Top Right):**
- Same fanned card stack from the camera screen (1-4 cards based on count)
- Mirrors the camera footer's card fan effect

**Hold-to-Reveal Area (Bottom):**
- Large rectangle spanning bottom of screen with rounded corners
- Neon purple gradient background: dark on edges, lighter in middle
- Text: "Hold to open photos" with small spinner icon to the left
- On press and hold:
  - Rectangle "fills up" left to right with animation
  - Fill gradient: darker on left, lighter on right
  - Spinner spins 2x faster during hold
  - Progress fills 1.25x faster than current implementation
  - Haptic feedback starts small and intensifies as bar fills up

</vision>

## What Must Be Nailed

- **The hold-to-reveal interaction** — The neon purple gradient fill animation with intensifying haptic feedback is the centerpiece. It needs to feel satisfying and premium.
- The visual feedback loop: press → see fill → feel haptics build → release at completion

## What's Out of Scope

- The actual darkroom triage UI (full-screen photo reveal/swipe experience stays as-is)
- Photo reveal animations (how photos animate when revealed)
- Notification/badge changes on camera screen

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Dark theme consistent with app
- Neon purple gradient for the hold button (dark edges → light center)
- Fill animation gradient (dark left → light right)
- Green/red status dot for developing vs revealed state
- Spinner speed doubles during hold interaction
- Progress bar 1.25x faster than current
- Haptic feedback crescendo: starts light, intensifies with progress

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is specifically the bottom sheet that appears when tapping the darkroom card button on the camera screen — not the actual darkroom triage experience. The focus is on making the "hold to reveal" interaction feel premium and satisfying with coordinated visual and haptic feedback.
