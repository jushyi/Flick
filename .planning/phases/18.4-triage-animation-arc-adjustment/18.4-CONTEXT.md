# Phase 18.4: Triage Animation Arc Adjustment - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When swiping a photo to Journal or Archive, the card should follow an **exponential curve** rather than the current linear arc. The motion starts flat/horizontal, then gradually steepens as the card exits — like something being flicked that naturally falls away with momentum.

The rotation follows the same exponential curve: the card starts upright and gradually rotates as it accelerates off screen. This creates a cohesive, physics-based feel where both the path and rotation increase together.

The overall effect should feel like real-world momentum — smooth acceleration rather than an immediate downward dive.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Natural physics feel** — The exponential curve should feel like real-world momentum with smooth acceleration
- **Cohesive motion** — Arc path and rotation follow the same curve, increasing together
- **Gradual transition** — Starts flat/upright, steepens/rotates as it exits

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Delete animation unchanged — suction effect from Phase 18.3 stays as-is
- Timing/duration unchanged — not changing how long animations take, just the motion path
- Z-index layering — already handled in Phase 18.3

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Current linear arc feels unnatural — dives down immediately
- Exponential curve: y-displacement increases as x-displacement increases (steeper over time)
- Rotation curve matches: starts near 0°, increases as card moves further from center

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is a refinement of the flick animation from Phase 17-02. The goal is making the existing animation feel more polished and physics-based, not a complete redesign.
