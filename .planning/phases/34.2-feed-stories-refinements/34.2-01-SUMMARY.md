## Decisions Made

| Decision                               | Rationale                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Story cards 88x130 rectangular         | User wanted bigger, more rectangular cards like Instagram stories |
| Profile photo at bottom of story cards | User requested this layout change                                 |
| Feed cards horizontal layout           | User preferred original format over overlapping profile design    |
| Flexbox centering (left:0, right:0)    | Percentage-based centering was off; flexbox is more reliable      |

## Deviations from Plan

### Modified from Plan

**1. Task 2 redesigned per user feedback**

- **Original:** Compact 68x68 square cards without profile photo
- **Changed to:** Tall 88x130 rectangular cards with profile photo at bottom
- **Reason:** User wanted bigger, more rectangular cards with profile photo

**2. Task 3 reverted per user feedback**

- **Original:** Profile photo overlapping bottom edge of feed photos
- **Changed to:** Horizontal infoRow layout (profile on left, name/timestamp on right)
- **Reason:** User preferred the original horizontal format

---

**Total deviations:** 2 modifications based on user feedback
**Impact on plan:** Better UX based on direct user input

## Issues Encountered

None - all changes executed successfully with user feedback incorporated

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 34.2 complete
- Ready for Phase 36 (Comments Feature) or Phase 37 (Profile Placeholder)
