# Phase 18.2: Rename App to Rewind - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The app transforms from "Lapse" to "Rewind" with a cohesive retro identity. When users download the app, they see a classic VHS cassette icon — rectangular with visible tape reels, evoking that nostalgic 80s/90s feel.

When they open the app for the first time (or any time), a camera iris aperture animation plays — circular blades opening from the center like a real camera lens, revealing the main interface. It should feel like you're stepping into a real photo experience.

Every trace of "Lapse" disappears: the display name, notifications, deep links (rewind://), documentation, code references. The rebrand is complete and thorough.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Retro VHS app icon** - Classic rectangular cassette with visible tape reels, nostalgic 80s/90s aesthetic
- **Camera iris opening animation** - Circular aperture blades opening from center on app launch
- **Complete name transition** - Every "Lapse" reference becomes "Rewind" (display name, strings, deep links, docs, code)
- All three elements must land together for the rebrand to feel complete

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- No UI theme changes (keep current colors, fonts, layout — just name and branding assets)
- No App Store listing prep (metadata, screenshots, descriptions are a future phase)
- No marketing assets (social media graphics, promo materials come later)

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- VHS icon: Classic rectangular tape with visible reels, not minimalist/abstract
- Iris animation: Camera aperture blades (like a real camera lens), not vertical blinds or film countdown
- Deep link scheme changes from lapse:// to rewind://

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase includes the original rebrand scope (name changes everywhere) plus two new visual identity elements (VHS icon and iris animation). The icon and animation establish the app's nostalgic, film-camera identity that the name "Rewind" evokes.
