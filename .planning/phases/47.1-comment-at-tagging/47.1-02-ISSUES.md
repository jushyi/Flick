## Open Issues

### UAT-001: @-trigger requires extra character before overlay appears

**Discovered:** 2026-02-11
**Phase/Plan:** 47.1-02
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** @-trigger autocomplete
**Description:** Typing `@` alone does not show the suggestion overlay. The overlay only appears after typing one additional character after `@` (e.g., `@a`).
**Expected:** Overlay should appear immediately when `@` is typed, showing all mutual friends
**Actual:** Overlay only appears after typing `@` + at least one character
**Repro:**

1. Open any photo's comments
2. Type `@` in the comment input
3. Observe: no overlay appears
4. Type one more character (e.g., `@a`)
5. Overlay now appears

### UAT-002: @mention profile navigation renders behind current view

**Discovered:** 2026-02-11
**Phase/Plan:** 47.1-02
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** @mention profile navigation
**Description:** Tapping an @mention in a posted comment (non-reply) causes the profile to render behind the full-screen photo view and bottom sheet instead of navigating properly. Closing the photo view briefly shows the profile but also closes it. Multiple taps can leave the view in a stuck state where no buttons work.
**Expected:** Tapping @mention should navigate to the mentioned user's profile screen (pushing a new screen or dismissing the current view first)
**Actual:** Profile renders underneath the current view stack. Dismissing the photo view briefly shows and then closes the profile. Repeated taps can freeze the UI.
**Repro:**

1. Open a photo's comments
2. Find a posted comment with an @mention (non-reply)
3. Tap the @mentioned username
4. Observe: nothing visually changes — profile rendered behind
5. Close the bottom sheet and photo view
6. Profile flashes briefly then disappears
7. (Optional) Tap @mention multiple times rapidly — view may get stuck

### UAT-003: Reply autocomplete selection leaks trigger character

**Discovered:** 2026-02-11
**Phase/Plan:** 47.1-02
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Reply @-mention autocomplete
**Description:** When composing a reply and using @-autocomplete, after selecting a suggestion, the first character typed after `@` (the trigger character) gets appended after the inserted @username with a space. This sometimes re-triggers the suggestion overlay.
**Expected:** Selecting a suggestion should cleanly replace `@query` with `@username` — no leftover characters
**Actual:** `@a` → select "Alice" → text becomes `@alice a` (the trigger char `a` leaks through with a space). Sometimes the leaked character re-triggers suggestions.
**Repro:**

1. Open comments on a photo
2. Tap "Reply" on an existing comment
3. After the auto-inserted @mention, type some text then `@a` (or any `@` + letter)
4. Select a suggestion from the overlay
5. Observe: the `@username` is inserted but the original trigger letter appears after it with a space
