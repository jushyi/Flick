  <name>Task 1: Fix UAT-001 - Increase photo card size and balance vertical spacing</name>
  <files>src/components/SwipeablePhotoCard.js, src/screens/DarkroomScreen.js</files>
  <action>
User feedback: Card is too small. Also wants balanced spacing - same distance from header to card top as from card bottom to triage buttons.

**In SwipeablePhotoCard.js:**
1. Change photoCard width from 0.92 to 0.95 of SCREEN_WIDTH (95% width)
2. Change photoImage aspectRatio from 4/5 (0.8) to 3/4 (0.75) - make it TALLER
3. Verify borderWidth: 2 and borderColor: '#000000' still applied

**In DarkroomScreen.js:**
4. Find the container/wrapper that holds the photo card and triage buttons
5. Ensure the photo card has equal margin/padding above (space to header) and below (space to triage bar)
6. Use consistent spacing value (e.g., 16px or 20px) for both top and bottom margins around the card
7. The photo should be vertically centered between the header and triage buttons

The goal is symmetrical layout: header → [equal space] → photo card → [equal space] → triage buttons
  </action>
  <verify>Visual inspection: Photo card is larger, taller, and vertically centered with equal spacing top and bottom</verify>
  <done>Photo cards are 95% width, 3:4 aspect ratio (taller), with balanced vertical spacing from header and triage bar</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fix UAT-002 - Resize triage buttons to fill width with consistent height</name>
  <files>src/screens/DarkroomScreen.js</files>
  <action>
User feedback: Archive and Journal buttons are too spaced apart. Delete button height/style is good. Archive/Journal should match Delete's height and fill remaining horizontal space with minimal gaps.

Redesign triage button layout:
1. Make all three buttons the same height (56px to match Delete's height)
2. Delete stays circular (56x56) in center
3. Archive and Journal become flex: 1 to fill remaining space on each side
4. Reduce gaps between buttons - use gap: 8 or marginHorizontal: 4 instead of justifyContent: 'space-between'
5. Remove the wide paddingHorizontal: 40, use paddingHorizontal: 16 instead

Layout should be: [Archive (flex:1)] [8px gap] [Delete (56px circle)] [8px gap] [Journal (flex:1)]

Keep same colors:
- Archive: #8E8E93 (gray)
- Delete: #FF3B30 (red)
- Journal: #34C759 (green)

Keep same icons and haptic feedback.
  </action>
  <verify>Visual inspection: Three buttons fill full width with minimal gaps, all same height</verify>
  <done>Triage buttons are same height (56px), fill screen width with 8px gaps between them</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Fixed photo card sizing and triage button layout</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open darkroom with revealed photo
    2. Photo card should fill majority of screen (noticeably larger)
    3. Triage buttons should be same height, filling width with small gaps
    4. Test each button still works (Archive, Delete, Journal)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe remaining issues</resume-signal>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Photo card noticeably larger (95% width, 3:4 aspect ratio - taller)
- [ ] Equal spacing above card (from header) and below card (to triage buttons)
- [ ] All three triage buttons same height (56px)
- [ ] Buttons fill available width with minimal gaps
- [ ] All triage actions still work with haptic feedback
- [ ] App runs without errors

<success_criteria>
- All UAT issues from 17-01-ISSUES.md addressed
- User verifies fixes during checkpoint
- Ready for re-verification or next phase
