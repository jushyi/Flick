**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 17-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Photo card sizing
**Description:** Photo card appears too small despite 92% width and 4:5 aspect ratio changes. User expected larger card filling more screen space.
**Expected:** Photo card should fill majority of available screen real estate
**Actual:** Card is smaller than expected
**Repro:**
1. Open darkroom with revealed photo

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 17-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Three-button triage bar
**Description:** Archive and Journal buttons are too spaced apart from Delete button. Delete button styling is good. User wants Archive and Journal buttons to match Delete button height and fill remaining horizontal space with only slight boundaries between them.
**Expected:** All three buttons same height, filling full width of triage bar with minimal gaps
**Actual:** Buttons too spaced apart, Archive/Journal don't match Delete button height
**Repro:**
1. Open darkroom with revealed photo
2. Look at triage button bar below photo
3. Compare Archive/Journal button size to Delete button
