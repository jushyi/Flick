# Phase 15.2-01-FIX4: Restore Zoom Level Mappings Summary

**Restored original zoom level mappings so 0.5x shows wider view than 1x**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T19:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T19:02:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Restored zoom level mappings from 15.2-01: 0.5x=0, 1x=0.17, 3x=0.33
- 0.5x now shows visibly wider view than 1x (baseline vs slight zoom)
- Fixed regression introduced in FIX3 where 1x was incorrectly set to 0

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Restore zoom mappings** - `6bb2c27` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** TBD (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/screens/CameraScreen.js` - ZOOM_LEVELS cameraZoom values restored

## Decisions Made

- Original 15.2-01 design was intentional: 1x is slightly zoomed (0.17) so 0.5x at 0 feels wider
- FIX3's "correction" to set 1x=0 was based on misunderstanding expo-camera semantics

## Deviations from Plan

Plan was simplified - instead of investigating expo-camera ultra-wide capabilities, restored original values per user direction.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All zoom levels working as originally designed
- Ready for re-verification and phase 15.2-02
