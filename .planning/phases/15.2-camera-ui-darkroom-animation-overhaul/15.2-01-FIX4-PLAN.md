  <name>Task 1: Investigate expo-camera ultra-wide capability</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
Research expo-camera documentation and React Native camera capabilities for ultra-wide (0.5x) zoom.

Current state:
- ZOOM_LEVELS has 0.5x with cameraZoom: 0 (same as 1x)
- expo-camera zoom range is 0-1 where 0 = no zoom (1x), 1 = max digital zoom
- Cannot go below 0 for wider view

Options to investigate:
1. expo-camera may support negative zoom values or a different API for ultra-wide lens
2. Device may not have ultra-wide lens (iPhone limitation)
3. Need to use a different camera type/lens selector

If ultra-wide is NOT supported by expo-camera:
- Remove 0.5x from ZOOM_LEVELS (user confusion to show option that does nothing)
- Update zoom levels to just: 1x, 2x, 3x (all achievable via digital zoom)

If ultra-wide IS supported:
- Update cameraZoom value for 0.5x to use correct API
- Test that it actually shows wider view
  </action>
  <verify>
- Check expo-camera docs for ultra-wide support
- If removed: ZOOM_LEVELS only has 1x, 2x, 3x
- If fixed: 0.5x actually shows wider view than 1x
  </verify>
  <done>0.5x either works correctly OR is removed from UI to avoid user confusion</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] 0.5x zoom either shows wider view OR is removed
- [ ] Remaining zoom levels (1x, 2x/3x) still work correctly
- [ ] No visual glitches in zoom bar

<success_criteria>
- UAT-001 from 15.2-01-FIX3-ISSUES.md addressed
- Zoom functionality working as expected
- Ready for re-verification
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/15.2-camera-ui-darkroom-animation-overhaul/15.2-01-FIX4-SUMMARY.md`
