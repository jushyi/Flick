# Phase 15.2 Plan 01-FIX: UAT Fixes Summary

**Fixed 4 UAT issues: reduced footer height, repositioned floating controls above camera, removed camera preview outline, and refined zoom bar styling**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T15:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T15:38:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Reduced footer height from 280px to 200px (~1/4 of screen)
- Moved flash/flip buttons to float above footer over camera preview
- Added floating controls container with space-between layout
- Removed camera preview black outline with explicit borderWidth: 0
- Reduced zoom options from 4 to 3 (removed 2x)
- Added 'x' suffix only to selected zoom level

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix UAT-001 footer height** - `5d47149` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Fix UAT-002 flash/flip buttons** - `047639c` (fix)
3. **Task 3: Fix UAT-003 camera outline** - `403f3de` (fix)
4. **Task 4: Fix UAT-004 zoom bar** - `87e25e6` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/screens/CameraScreen.js` - All 4 UAT fixes applied:
  - FOOTER_HEIGHT: 280px → 200px
  - Added floatingControls and floatingButton styles
  - Added borderWidth: 0 and backgroundColor to cameraContainer
  - ZOOM_LEVELS: removed 2x, kept .5, 1, 3
  - Added zoomLabelContainer and zoomSuffix styles

## Decisions Made

- Footer height set to 200px for ~1/4 screen coverage
- Floating button size set to 45px (10% smaller than 50px footer buttons)
- Floating button offset set to 8px above footer
- Floating buttons use semi-transparent black background (rgba(0,0,0,0.4)) for visibility over camera

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward CSS/layout changes.

## Next Phase Readiness

- UAT issues from 15.2-01 resolved
- Camera UI ready for re-verification
- Ready for 15.2-02: Darkroom button card stack
