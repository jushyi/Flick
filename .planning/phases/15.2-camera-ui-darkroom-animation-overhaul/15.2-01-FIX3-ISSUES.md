### UAT-001: 0.5x zoom shows same view as 1x

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01-FIX3
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Zoom levels
**Description:** When tapping 0.5x on the zoom bar, the camera view appears the same as 1x - there's no visible difference/wider angle.
**Expected:** 0.5x should show a wider angle view than 1x
**Actual:** 0.5x and 1x show identical camera view
**Repro:**
1. Open camera screen
2. Tap 1x on zoom bar, note the view
3. Tap 0.5x on zoom bar
4. View appears the same as 1x

**Resolved:** 2026-01-21 - Fixed in 15.2-01-FIX4
**Commit:** 6bb2c27
**Fix:** Restored original zoom level mappings from 15.2-01 (0.5x=0, 1x=0.17, 3x=0.33). FIX3 incorrectly changed 1x to 0, making it identical to 0.5x.
