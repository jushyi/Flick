### UAT-004: Zoom bar positioning, options, and label styling

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Zoom control bar
**Description:** Multiple issues with zoom bar:
1. **Position:** Should float above camera preview (like flash/flip buttons), centered horizontally, at the same height as flash/flip buttons - NOT in the footer
2. **Options:** Remove 2x zoom level. Only show 3 options: 0.5, 1, and 3
3. **Label styling:** The 'x' suffix should ONLY appear on the currently selected zoom level (not all labels). The 'x' should be vertically centered on the number.
**Expected:**
- Zoom bar floats above camera, centered, same height as flash/flip buttons
- Three zoom options: .5, 1, 3
- Selected level shows "1x" with vertically centered x; unselected show ".5" and "3" (no x)
**Actual:** Zoom bar in footer, 4 options, no 'x' on any label
**Repro:** Open Camera tab and look at the zoom control bar
**Resolution:** 2026-01-21 - Fixed in 15.2-01-FIX: moved to floatingControls, removed 2x, added conditional 'x' suffix
