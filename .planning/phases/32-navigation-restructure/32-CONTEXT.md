# Phase 32: Navigation Restructure - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Instagram-style 3-tab layout: Feed on the left, Camera in the center, Profile on the right. The camera button sits in the middle but stays visually consistent with the other tabs — same size, not elevated or given special styling. Just centered.

The current 4th tab (Friends) goes away entirely. That functionality moves to the notifications/activity page, which comes in Phase 33.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Cleaner, simpler layout** - Reducing from 4 tabs to 3 removes clutter and feels more focused. This is the core win.
- **Camera one tap away** - Center position keeps capture easily accessible

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Feed header changes (logo, notifications bell) — that's Phase 33
- Profile screen content changes — just the tab navigation, not the screen itself
- Friends functionality relocation — removed from tabs now, added to activity page in Phase 33

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Match current tab bar styling — no visual redesign, just restructure the tabs
- Camera button same size as Feed/Profile icons, just positioned center

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The Friends tab disappearing is intentional. Phase 33 combines friend requests with the activity/notifications feed (Instagram-style), so Friends functionality will live there instead of having its own tab.
