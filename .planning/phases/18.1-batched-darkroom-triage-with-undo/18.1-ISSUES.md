### UAT-001: Black flash after cascade animation (carried from UAT-015) - RESOLVED

**Discovered:** 2026-01-22 (originally identified in Phase 17)
**Phase/Plan:** 18.1 (deferred from Phase 17)
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Card triage animation / cascade effect
**Description:** Top card briefly flashes black after cascade animation completes. The animation fix noted in Phase 17 (UAT-015) was deferred to Phase 18.1 but was not implemented.
**Expected:** Smooth card cascade with no visual glitch
**Actual:** Black flash visible at end of cascade animation
**Repro:**
1. Open darkroom with multiple photos
2. Swipe a card to triage
3. Watch the cascade animation complete
4. Observe brief black flash on top card

**Resolution:** Added timing-based blur overlay fade-out (200ms with ease-out easing) when card transitions from stack position to front position. This gives the Image component time to fully render before the overlay fades, preventing the brief black flash.
**Fixed in:** 18.1-FIX-PLAN.md
