**From Phase 51 research:**

- Apple now auto-scales screenshots from 6.9" (iPhone 16 Pro Max) set to other sizes
- Privacy manifests already configured in app.json
- EU trader status declaration required for ALL developers
- ascAppId is found in App Store Connect > App Information > Apple ID (not Apple Developer account ID)

**From 53-CONTEXT.md:**

- Clean, minimal presence matching dark aesthetic
- Simple description, let app speak for itself
- Professional polish even for quiet launch
- App Store link will be shared directly via text/DM to friends and family

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Create App Store Connect app listing with metadata</action>
  <instructions>
I'll guide you through creating the App Store Connect listing. This requires your Apple Developer account access.

**Steps to complete:**

1. **Go to App Store Connect** (appstoreconnect.apple.com)
   - Sign in with your Apple Developer account
   - Click "My Apps" → "+" → "New App"

2. **Create App Listing:**
   - Platform: iOS
   - Name: "Flick"
   - Primary Language: English (U.S.)
   - Bundle ID: Select `com.spoodsjs.flick` from dropdown
   - SKU: `flick-v1-0-0` (internal identifier, not shown to users)
   - User Access: Full Access

3. **After creation, note the Apple ID:**
   - Go to App Information (left sidebar)
   - Under General Information, find "Apple ID" (10-digit number)
   - **Copy this number** - it's needed for eas.json as ascAppId

4. **Set App Category:**
   - App Store tab → App Information
   - Primary Category: "Photo & Video"
   - Secondary Category: "Social Networking" (optional)

5. **Fill Required Metadata (Version Information):**
   - Go to "1.0 Prepare for Submission"
   - **Screenshots:** Skip for now (Task 2 will generate these)
   - **Description:**

     ```
     Capture life's moments with friends. Photos develop over time, revealed in batches like a disposable camera.

     • Share photos with close friends only
     • Photos "develop" overnight before revealing
     • Comment, react, and tag friends
     • Create albums and customize your profile

     Flick brings back the anticipation of disposable cameras in a private, friends-only space.
     ```

   - **Keywords:** `photo,camera,friends,social,disposable,memories,private` (max 100 chars)
   - **Support URL:** `https://flickcam.app/support` (from Phase 51-04)
   - **Marketing URL:** Leave blank (no marketing for this launch)
   - **What's New in This Version:**
     ```
     Initial release of Flick - your private photo sharing app with a disposable camera twist.
     ```

6. **Age Rating:**
   - Click "Edit" next to Age Rating
   - Answer questionnaire honestly (likely 12+ due to user-generated content and photo sharing)
   - Social media with user-generated content → Yes
   - Photo/video sharing → Yes
   - Profanity/crude humor → No (unless users add it, but content is private)

7. **App Review Information:**
   - Contact Information: Your email and phone
   - **Demo Account:** Create a test account with phone number that works
     - Username: (test account you create)
     - Password: (test account password)
     - Notes: "Use phone authentication to sign in. Test account has sample photos and friends."
   - **Notes:**

     ```
     Flick is a private photo-sharing app for close friends. Photos are taken immediately but "develop" overnight (revealed at 9am next day), recreating the disposable camera experience.

     The app uses Firebase Phone Authentication (SMS code). Test credentials provided use a real phone number.

     Key features to test:
     - Phone authentication (sign in with test account)
     - Camera capture and darkroom (photos develop overnight)
     - Feed with friends' photos
     - Comments and reactions
     - Profile customization
     ```

8. **Version Release:**
   - Select "Manually release this version" (you control when it goes live after approval)

When you've completed these steps and have the Apple ID (ascAppId), reply with the 10-digit Apple ID number.

<verification>After you provide the Apple ID, I'll update eas.json with the ascAppId value</verification>
<resume-signal>Provide the Apple ID (10-digit number) from App Store Connect</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Generate and upload App Store screenshots</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/53-app-store-release/screenshot-instructions.md</files>
  <action>
Create instructions for capturing dark-themed screenshots that match Flick's aesthetic. Apple requires 6.9" iPhone screenshots (iPhone 16 Pro Max / 15 Pro Max / 14 Pro Max) and now auto-scales to other sizes.

**Screenshot Plan (6-8 images):**

1. **Login/Onboarding** - Show phone auth screen (dark UI, welcoming)
2. **Camera/Darkroom** - Darkroom screen with developing photos and countdown
3. **Feed** - Feed with photo cards, reactions visible (show social aspect)
4. **Photo Detail** - Fullscreen photo view with comments (show engagement)
5. **Profile** - User profile with albums, Selects banner, profile song
6. **Stories** - Friend stories bar with unread indicators
7. **Comments** - Comments bottom sheet showing @mentions and replies
8. **Albums** (optional) - Album grid showing monthly/custom albums

**Screenshot Specifications:**

- Device: iPhone 16 Pro Max, 15 Pro Max, or 14 Pro Max simulator
- Size: 1320 x 2868 pixels (6.9" display)
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Orientation: Portrait only (app is portrait-locked)
- Status bar: Clean (no 1% battery, use 100%, good signal)

**Dark Aesthetic Guidelines:**

- Background should be #0A0A1A (app's dark background)
- Showcase the dark UI theme
- Use real-looking test data (not Lorem Ipsum)
- Show populated screens (not empty states)
- Include name colors if contributor feature is visible

**Capture Process:**
Since you're using Expo, the simulator approach:

```bash
# Start iOS simulator (iPhone 16 Pro Max)
npx expo start --ios
# Or select iPhone 16 Pro Max in Xcode simulator menu

# Navigate to each screen and capture:
# CMD+S in simulator saves to Desktop
# Or use CMD+SHIFT+4 for manual crop

# Verify dimensions:
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight screenshot.png
# Should show 1320x2868 for 6.9" device
```

**Manual Alternative (faster):**
If simulator screenshots are cumbersome, provide instructions for user to capture on their iPhone 16 Pro Max device:

1. Install build on device via TestFlight or direct install
2. Navigate to each screen
3. Press Volume Up + Side Button to screenshot
4. AirDrop to Mac for upload

Create `screenshot-instructions.md` with:

- List of 6-8 screens to capture with specific navigation steps
- Technical specifications (dimensions, format)
- Aesthetic guidelines (dark theme, populated content)
- Capture process (simulator vs device)
- Upload steps to App Store Connect (drag into screenshots section)

**What to avoid:**

- Don't use emojis or playful captions in screenshots (keep minimal per CONTEXT.md vision)
- Don't show personal/sensitive data (use test accounts)
- Don't leave simulator chrome visible (use pure screenshot, no device frame)
- Don't mix screenshot sizes (all must be 6.9" / 1320x2868)

3. In App Store Connect → Version 1.0 → Screenshots
4. Under "iPhone 6.9" Display" section, drag and drop all screenshots
5. Arrange in order: Onboarding → Darkroom → Feed → Detail → Profile → Stories

**Part 2: Configure App Privacy**

1. **Go to App Privacy section** (left sidebar under App Store)
2. Click "Get Started"

3. **Data Collection Questions:**

   **Contact Info:**
   - Do you collect contact info? **YES**
   - Phone Number:
     - Collected: YES
     - Linked to identity: YES (used for auth)

     - Purpose: Analytics

4. **Privacy Policy URL:**
   - In App Information → General Information
   - Privacy Policy URL: `https://flickcam.app/privacy` (from Phase 51-04)

5. **EU Trader Status:**
   - App Store → Business → EU Digital Services Act
   - Set trader status: Select appropriate option (likely "Non-Trader" for individual developer)
   - This is REQUIRED for all developers per Phase 51 research pitfall #5

6. **Update eas.json after Task 1 checkpoint:**
   Once you receive the Apple ID from Task 1, I'll update eas.json:
   ```json
   "submit": {
     "production": {
       "ios": {
         "ascAppId": "YOUR_APPLE_ID_HERE"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

When screenshots are uploaded and App Privacy is configured, reply "privacy-configured".
</instructions>
<verification>After completion, verify App Store Connect shows: screenshots under 6.9" display, App Privacy summary shows data collected, EU trader status set</verification>
<resume-signal>Type "privacy-configured" when screenshots and privacy declarations are complete</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update eas.json with ascAppId</name>
  <files>eas.json</files>
  <action>
After receiving the Apple ID from Task 1's checkpoint, update eas.json to replace the placeholder.

Replace:

```json
"submit": {
  "production": {
    "ios": {
      "ascAppId": "PLACEHOLDER_SET_AFTER_ASC_SETUP"
    }
  }
}
```

With:

```json
"submit": {
  "production": {
    "ios": {
      "ascAppId": "ACTUAL_APPLE_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

Where ACTUAL_APPLE_ID is the 10-digit number provided by the user.

**What to avoid:**

- Don't use Apple Developer account ID (different from App Store Connect Apple ID)
- Don't use bundle ID or app name
- Don't add quotes around the number (it should be a string but the number itself)

After updating, stage and commit:

```bash
git add eas.json
git commit -m "chore(53-02): configure ascAppId for EAS Submit"
```

  </action>
  <verify>eas.json contains valid 10-digit ascAppId, git commit created</verify>
  <done>eas.json updated with ascAppId, ready for EAS Submit in Plan 3</done>
</task>

</tasks>
