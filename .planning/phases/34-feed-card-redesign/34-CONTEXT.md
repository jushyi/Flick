# Phase 34: Feed Card Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Feed cards should look like Polaroid photos. The classic instant-camera aesthetic — white frame with a thicker bottom edge, slightly aged/vintage feel. Not clinical white, but off-white with subtle shadows, like real Polaroids sitting on a surface.

The photos themselves stay untouched — no filters or effects applied. The Polaroid feel comes entirely from the frame treatment. This keeps with Rewind's "authentic photos" philosophy.

User info (name, timestamp, reactions) lives in the thick bottom white space, like handwriting on a real Polaroid. The feed layout stays the same — just the individual cards get the Polaroid treatment.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **The Polaroid frame design** — Getting that iconic white border with thick bottom edge exactly right. This is the heart of the redesign.

## What's Out of Scope

- New interaction patterns — keep existing tap-to-open behavior, focus purely on visual
- User info redesign — username, timestamp, reactions stay (just repositioned to Polaroid border)
- Stories integration — that's Phase 35
- Feed layout changes — same structure, just restyled cards

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Slightly aged/vintage feel — off-white frame, subtle shadows, tactile "Polaroid on a table" look
- User info in the bottom white space like handwriting
- Keep photos untouched (no filter effects)
- Keep current feed layout structure

</specifics>

## Additional Context

**Open question: Dark theme contrast**
The app currently has a dark theme. Light Polaroid frames against dark background could either be striking or jarring. User wants to see options during implementation:

- Full contrast (white/cream Polaroids pop against dark)
- Softened Polaroid (darker off-white or warm gray)
- Shadow/glow effects for depth

This should be explored visually during implementation with a few variations to choose from.
