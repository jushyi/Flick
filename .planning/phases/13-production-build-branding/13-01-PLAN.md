Purpose: Establish the visual identity for Oly that feels playful yet premium, with camera-inspired design.
Output: Updated icon.png, adaptive-icon.png, favicon.png, splash.png assets via Sharp scripts.

**Brand Direction (from CONTEXT.md):**
- App name: Oly
- Icon: Camera-inspired with integrated "O" (lens, aperture, or camera body)
- Energy: Playful and fun, but premium
- Colors: Should complement existing dark theme (in-app is dark, assets can be light/bright)

**Existing Patterns:**
@scripts/generate-icons.js - Sharp-based SVG-to-PNG pipeline
@scripts/generate-splash.js - Sharp-based splash generation
@app.json - Current Expo configuration (name already "Oly")

**Key Files:**
- assets/icon.png (1024x1024)
- assets/adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024, Android safe zones)
- assets/favicon.png (48x48)
- assets/splash.png (1284x2778)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create camera-inspired Oly icon</name>
  <files>scripts/generate-icons.js, assets/icon.png, assets/adaptive-icon.png, assets/favicon.png</files>
  <action>
Update generate-icons.js to create a camera-inspired icon with integrated "O":

**Design concept:** A stylized camera aperture/lens where the "O" is formed by the aperture blades or lens ring. This creates an icon that reads as both a camera element AND the letter "O" for Oly.

**Implementation:**
1. Create aperture-style SVG with 6-8 triangular blades forming a circular opening
2. The center opening (the aperture hole) IS the "O" - negative space design
3. Use a rich accent color for the blades (coral/orange #FF6B6B or teal #4ECDC4) on white background
4. The design should work at small sizes (favicon) - keep it simple, avoid tiny details

**Color options (pick one):**
- Coral aperture (#FF6B6B) on white - warm, playful
- Teal aperture (#4ECDC4) on white - fresh, modern
- Gradient from coral to orange - energetic

**SVG structure:**
- White square background
- 6 aperture blade shapes rotated 60° apart
- Each blade is a triangle/wedge pointing inward
- Blades create a circular opening in the center (the "O")

Run `node scripts/generate-icons.js` to generate all icon sizes.

  <name>Task 2: Update splash screen with Oly branding</name>
  <files>scripts/generate-splash.js, assets/splash.png</files>
  <action>
Update generate-splash.js to create Oly-branded splash:

**Design concept:** "OLY" text centered, using the same accent color as the icon. The splash should feel like it belongs with the icon.

**Implementation:**
1. Change text from "LAPSE" to "OLY"
2. Use the same accent color as the icon (#FF6B6B or #4ECDC4) for the text
3. Keep off-white background (#FAFAFA) to feel light/bright before entering dark app
4. Bold, modern sans-serif font
5. Letter-spacing for premium feel

**Note:** This is the STATIC splash. Animated splash will be added in Plan 02.

Run `node scripts/generate-splash.js` to generate splash.
  </action>
  <verify>
- assets/splash.png exists and is 1284x2778
- Visual inspection: shows "OLY" text in accent color, clean and readable
  </verify>
  <done>Splash screen generated with Oly branding, matches icon color scheme</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update app.json configuration</name>
  <files>app.json</files>
  <action>
Update app.json with Oly branding:

1. **Bundle identifier** - Change from "com.lapseclone.app" to "com.oly.app"
2. **Android package** - Change from "com.anonymous.lapsecloneapp" to "com.oly.app"
3. **Camera permission text** - Change from "Allow Lapse to..." to "Allow Oly to access your camera to take photos."
4. **Splash background** - Keep #FAFAFA (off-white) to match splash asset
5. **Verify name/slug** - Already "Oly" but confirm no Lapse references remain

Do NOT change:
- EAS project ID (keep existing)
- Firebase config paths (GoogleService-Info.plist)
- Plugin configurations
- Entitlements
  </action>
  <verify>
- No remaining "lapse" or "Lapse" strings in app.json (except possibly file paths)
- Bundle ID is "com.oly.app"
- Camera permission mentions "Oly"
  </verify>
  <done>app.json updated with Oly branding, bundle ID updated, all Lapse references removed</done>
</task>
