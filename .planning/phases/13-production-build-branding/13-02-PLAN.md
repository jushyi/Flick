<objective>
Implement animated splash screen with camera shutter reveal effect.

Purpose: Create a memorable launch experience that sets the tone for the darkroom/reveal concept.
Output: Animated splash screen that shows shutter opening on app launch.

**Animation Vision (from CONTEXT.md):**
- Shutter opening concept - sets tone for darkroom/reveal
- Not just static, but a moment that feels intentional
- Should feel like opening a camera

**Tech Stack:**
- expo-splash-screen for native splash control
- react-native-reanimated ~3.16.1 already installed
- Expo SDK ~54.0.30

**Pattern:**
- expo-splash-screen.hideAsync() called after animation completes
- Animation runs in App.js after app mounts
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Install and configure expo-splash-screen</name>
  <files>package.json, app.json</files>
  <action>
Install expo-splash-screen for native splash control:

```bash
npx expo install expo-splash-screen
```

Update app.json to add expo-splash-screen plugin if not auto-added:
```json
"plugins": [
  // existing plugins...
  "expo-splash-screen"
]
```

This allows the native splash to stay visible while the animated splash runs, then hide it programmatically.

  <verify>npm ls expo-splash-screen shows package installed</verify>
  <done>expo-splash-screen installed and configured in app.json</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create AnimatedSplash component</name>
  <files>src/components/AnimatedSplash.js, src/components/index.js</files>
  <action>
Create AnimatedSplash.js with shutter opening animation:

**Design:**
- Full screen overlay (absolute positioned)
- 6 aperture blades (matching icon design) that start closed
- Animation: blades rotate/scale outward to reveal the app behind
- Use the same accent color as icon
- Duration: ~800ms total

**Implementation using Reanimated:**
1. Create 6 triangular blade SVG shapes using react-native-svg
2. Each blade positioned at 60° intervals around center
3. Initial state: blades overlap to cover screen (closed aperture)
4. Animated state: blades rotate outward and scale (opening aperture)
5. Use withTiming or withSpring for smooth animation
6. After animation completes, hide the native splash and then fade out component

**Props:**
- onAnimationComplete: callback when animation finishes

**Structure:**
```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withTiming, runOnJS } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import Svg, { Path, G } from 'react-native-svg';

const AnimatedSplash = ({ onAnimationComplete }) => {
  const openProgress = useSharedValue(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    openProgress.value = withTiming(1, { duration: 800 }, (finished) => {
      if (finished) runOnJS(onAnimationComplete)();
    });
  }, []);

  // 6 animated blades that rotate/scale based on openProgress
  // ...
};
```

Export from src/components/index.js
  </action>
  <verify>
- src/components/AnimatedSplash.js exists
- Component exported from index.js
- No import errors
  </verify>
  <done>AnimatedSplash component created with shutter opening animation</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Integrate animated splash into App.js</name>
  <files>App.js</files>
  <action>
Update App.js to show AnimatedSplash on launch:

**Implementation:**
1. Import SplashScreen from expo-splash-screen
2. Import AnimatedSplash component
3. Add state: showSplash = true
4. Call SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() before component mounts (top-level)
5. Render AnimatedSplash when showSplash is true
6. In onAnimationComplete callback:
   - Call SplashScreen.hideAsync()
   - Set showSplash = false

**Code pattern:**
```javascript
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
import { AnimatedSplash } from './src/components';

// Prevent auto-hide before component mounts
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

export default function App() {
  const [showSplash, setShowSplash] = useState(true);

  const handleSplashComplete = async () => {
    await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    setShowSplash(false);
  };

  return (
    <>
      {/* Existing app content */}
      {showSplash && <AnimatedSplash onAnimationComplete={handleSplashComplete} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

The AnimatedSplash should render OVER the app content (absolute positioning) so the app is ready behind it.
  </action>
  <verify>
- App.js imports expo-splash-screen
- App.js imports AnimatedSplash
- SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() called
- AnimatedSplash rendered conditionally
  </verify>
  <done>Animated splash integrated into App.js launch flow</done>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: `npx expo start` (or reload the app in Expo Go)
    2. Observe app launch
    3. Confirm: Native splash shows briefly, then animated shutter opens
    4. Confirm: Animation is smooth (~800ms)
    5. Confirm: Shutter blades match icon color
    6. Confirm: Animation feels like a camera shutter opening
    7. Confirm: App is usable after animation completes
