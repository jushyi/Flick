# Phase 37.2: Stories Thumbnail Flash Fix & Feed Skeleton Update - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When you swipe down on the photo modal and return to the feed, the stories thumbnails should stay smooth. If they need to reload, they should fade in gracefully rather than flashing gray. The transition back should feel seamless and polished.

The feed loading skeleton should represent the current feed structure - both the stories row at the top and the full-width feed cards below. When the app is loading, users should see a clear preview of what's coming.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **No jarring visual glitches** - The app should feel smooth and polished, no gray flashes or visual jumps when returning from the photo modal
- **Accurate loading preview** - The skeleton should clearly represent the actual feed structure (stories row + feed cards)

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No fancy shimmer animations - just update the skeleton layout to match current structure
- No stories row redesign - fix the thumbnail flash, don't change how stories look or behave
- No underlying performance optimization - this is purely visual polish

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Smooth fade-in transition for thumbnails if they need to reload (instead of gray flash)
- Skeleton should include both stories row placeholder and feed card placeholders
- Keep existing skeleton animation style, just update the layout to match

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Both issues break the polished feel of the app and are equally important to fix. The focus is on visual refinement - making the app feel smooth and professional without adding new features or complexity.
