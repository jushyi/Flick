### UAT-001: External service dashboards still show old naming

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Phase/Plan:** 30-03
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Rewind rebrand completeness
**Description:** External service dashboards (Firebase, Google Cloud Console, Expo) still display old naming (Oly/Lapse Clone) rather than Rewind branding.
**Expected:** All external services should reflect Rewind branding for consistency
**Actual:** Firebase Console, Google Cloud Console, and Expo Dashboard all need naming updates

**Affected Services:**

- Firebase Console - Project name and app registrations
- Google Cloud Console - Project name, OAuth client display names
- Expo Dashboard - Project name/slug

**Note:** This was outside the scope of 30-03 (which focused on local app.json and source code). Consider addressing in 30-04 or 30-05 plans which are currently TBD.
