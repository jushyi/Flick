# Phase 30: Rewind Rebrand - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Complete visual overhaul — new identity from the ground up called "Rewind". When users open the app for the first time, they should feel "nostalgic but fresh" — familiar warmth with a modern edge.

The startup experience: splash screen shows the cassette tape icon with "Rewind" wordmark, then a camera shutter animation opens up to reveal the camera screen with a blur-to-focus effect (like a lens finding clarity). Quick but noticeable — snappy, not sluggish.

The cassette tape icon ties the name to the visual identity — "Rewind" makes sense when you see it. Simplified/abstract style, not a literal detailed cassette. Black background with the accent colors (purple, pink, teal, lime) inside.

Color tells a story in the darkroom: photos developing show a purple-to-pink gradient (mostly purple), and when photos are revealed the gradient shifts to mostly pink. Same treatment for the press-and-hold rectangle. Purple = anticipation, pink = payoff.

Camera screen stays mostly dark with subtle color touches — focus stays on what you're shooting. The bold gradients live in the darkroom where the "developing" story unfolds.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Cohesive identity** — icon, splash, startup animation, and in-app colors all speaking the same language
- **The cassette tape icon** — simplified/abstract, instantly recognizable, works at small sizes
- **Purple-to-pink gradient storytelling** — developing vs revealed states feel meaningfully different
- **Startup animation** — shutter opening + blur-to-focus must feel polished and quick

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- User-selectable themes/personalization — that's Phase 31
- Component redesigns (feed cards, modals, buttons) — just brand assets and color tokens
- Full UI overhaul — focused on icon, splash, animation, color system, darkroom treatment

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

**Color Palette (Modern Retro from assets/IMG_6568.png):**

- Dark/black backgrounds
- Purple as primary accent
- Pink as secondary (gradient partner)
- Teal and lime as tertiary (minimal use, maybe just in icon)

**App Icon:**

- Cassette tape, simplified/abstract
- Black background with accent colors inside
- Should read as "tape" without being literal

**Splash Screen:**

- Cassette tape icon centered
- "Rewind" wordmark beneath in retro display font (rounded, playful, or vintage character)
- Then transitions to shutter animation

**Startup Animation:**

- Camera shutter opening effect
- Blur-to-focus like a lens finding clarity
- Quick but noticeable

**Darkroom Colors:**

- Developing photos: purple → pink gradient (mostly purple)
- Revealed photos: same gradient but mostly pink
- Press-and-hold rectangle: same gradient treatment
- Camera screen: subtle color touches only, mostly dark

**Typography:**

- Retro/display font for wordmark — something with character
- Rounded, playful, or vintage feel that matches cassette vibe

**References:**

- Analog camera apps (HUJI, Dispo, 1888) — that film aesthetic but with modern retro spin
- Not warm/faded film tones — bold, dark, neon accents instead

## Additional Context

The name "Rewind" and the cassette tape icon tell the same story — users will get it immediately. The whole identity reinforces the core concept of photos that "develop" over time.

Color hierarchy is intentional:

1. Purple and pink do the heavy lifting (brand story)
2. Teal and lime stay in reserve (icon accents, occasional highlights)

The "nostalgic but fresh" feeling comes from pairing familiar objects (cassette tapes, camera shutters) with contemporary colors and snappy animations.
