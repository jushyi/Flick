**Key notes for v1.1:**

- Phase 6 is OTA-deployable (no native build needed)
- Phases 7-9 share a single EAS native build (expo-screen-capture + expo-live-activity)
- expo-live-activity is early-stage (MEDIUM confidence) — Voltra is documented fallback
- PINI features use App Groups workaround for photo thumbnails in Live Activities
