# Roadmap: Auth & Profile Refactor

## Overview

Transform Lapse Clone's authentication experience and profile system from inconsistent placeholders into polished, cohesive screens that match the app's established dark aesthetic. This journey starts with shared auth components, refactors login/signup flows, extends onboarding to capture full profile data, and builds out the profile screen with Selects banner, profile song, and album galleries.
