<objective>
Configure infrastructure for snap lifecycle: Firebase Storage rules for snap-photos/ path, Firestore security rules for snap message fields, and document the TTL/lifecycle configurations needed. Includes a human checkpoint to confirm infrastructure configurations are applied.

Purpose: Without correct security rules, snap uploads and viewedAt updates will fail. Storage lifecycle and Firestore TTL provide automatic cleanup of orphaned snaps as safety nets behind the Cloud Functions.
Output: Updated storage.rules, firestore.rules, infrastructure documentation, confirmed infrastructure config.

  <name>Task 1: Update Storage and Firestore security rules + document infrastructure config</name>

  </files>
  <action>
**storage.rules:**

Add a new rule block for `snap-photos/` following the same pattern as the existing `photos/` rule. Read the current storage.rules file first.

Add under the existing rules:

```
match /snap-photos/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  // Owner can upload snap photos
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  // Direct reads restricted to owner only; others access via Admin SDK signed URLs
  allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

This matches the `photos/{userId}/{allPaths=**}` pattern already in the file. Non-owners access snap photos exclusively via the `getSignedSnapUrl` Cloud Function (which uses Admin SDK and bypasses security rules).

Add `cacheControl` metadata validation if the existing rules check metadata on uploads:

- Snap uploads should have `contentType` matching `image/jpeg` or `image/png`

**firestore.rules:**

Read the current firestore.rules file first. The research confirmed that `viewedAt` and `screenshotted` update permissions already exist (lines 428-432). Verify this is still the case.

Add/verify the following fields are allowed in message document writes:

- `snapStoragePath` (string) -- allowed in message creation (same participant rules as other message fields)
- `caption` (string or null) -- allowed in message creation
- `expiresAt` (timestamp) -- allowed in message creation
- `viewedAt` (timestamp) -- UPDATE permission for non-sender already exists, verify it covers snap messages specifically

The key rule to verify/add: the existing message creation rule must allow the new fields (`snapStoragePath`, `caption`, `expiresAt`, `viewedAt`). If the rules use a whitelist of allowed fields, add these. If they use `request.resource.data` validation, ensure snap fields pass validation.

Also verify that the `cleanupExpiredSnaps` Cloud Function can delete message documents -- this uses Admin SDK so it bypasses rules, but document it.

Do NOT modify any existing rules that work for text/gif/image/reaction messages. Only add snap-specific allowances.

**functions/index.js -- Infrastructure documentation:**

Add comment blocks at the top of the snap-related Cloud Functions section documenting the required configurations:

**INFRA-03: Firestore TTL policy:**

```javascript
/**
 * INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENT (INFRA-03):
 * Firestore TTL policy must be configured on the messages collection group:
 *   Collection group: messages
 *   TTL field: expiresAt
 *
 * Configure via gcloud CLI:
 *   gcloud firestore fields ttls update expiresAt \
 *     --collection-group=messages \
 *     --enable-ttl \
 *     --project=flick-prod-49615
 *
 * Or via Firebase Console:
 *   Firestore -> Indexes -> TTL Policies -> Create policy
 *   Collection group ID: messages
 *   Timestamp field: expiresAt
 *
 * NOTE: TTL deletion is NOT instant (can take up to 24h after expiry).
 * Primary cleanup path is onSnapViewed. TTL is a safety net only.
 */
```

**INFRA-04: Storage lifecycle rule:**

```javascript
/**
 * INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENT (INFRA-04):
 * Firebase Storage lifecycle rule on snap-photos/ path:
 *   Condition: matchesPrefix ["snap-photos/"]
 *   Action: Delete
 *   Age: 7 days
 *
 * Configure via gsutil:
 *   gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://[bucket-name]
 *
 * lifecycle.json:
 *   {
 *     "rule": [{
 *       "action": { "type": "Delete" },
 *       "condition": { "age": 7, "matchesPrefix": ["snap-photos/"] }
 *     }]
 *   }
 *
 * Or via GCS Console:
 *   Cloud Storage -> [bucket] -> Lifecycle -> Add rule
 *
 * This is a safety net for orphaned snap photos. Primary cleanup is onSnapViewed.
 */
```

Also verify the `cleanupExpiredSnaps` scheduled function has the schedule expression `every 2 hours`.

  <action>
Human checkpoint to confirm infrastructure configurations. Security rules have been updated and documented. The following configurations require manual setup via Firebase Console or gcloud CLI -- they cannot be deployed via code.

INFRA-03 (Firestore TTL): Run the gcloud CLI command documented in functions/index.js, OR configure via Firebase Console -> Firestore -> TTL Policies. Confirm the TTL policy is active on the messages collection group targeting expiresAt field.

INFRA-04 (Storage lifecycle): Run the gsutil command documented in functions/index.js, OR configure via GCS Console -> Lifecycle rules. Confirm the lifecycle rule targets snap-photos/ prefix with 7-day Delete action.

Both configurations are safety nets -- the app functions without them, but orphaned snaps will not auto-cleanup. You can defer these to after launch if preferred, but they should be applied before going to production.

Type "configured" if both are applied, "deferred" if you want to apply them later, or describe any issues.
